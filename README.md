The objective is to compare quasar light curves perturbed by microlensing due to point-mass stars with due to dark matter microhalos.
The code consists of three sections. 
(1) Determine the lenses to generate a magnificaiton map
(2) Determine the source (quasar) size and trajectory to synthesize a magnification curve
(3) Statistically analyze the magnification curve with power spectrum
